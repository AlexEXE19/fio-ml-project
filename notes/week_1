# Getting used with the working environment, install the required python libraries and get to know the lab colleagues

# Self-studying basic machine learning concepts in regression, reinforcement learning and cleaning data concepts for the upcoming project

# Received 2 datasets, and a readme file describing briefly the content

# Analyze the content of one of the datasets, understanding the columns and way of measurement

# Cleaning the data that might skew the model such as the null rows and outliers that I have found in one of the columns

# Building a simple 2nd degree regression model that tries to predict the dispatch column for the wiops and latency feature columns

# Calculating the coefficient of determination of the model and receiving a score of 0.9381
